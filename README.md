## Tag Notation

* Add a tag by prefixing a tagname with a plus sign: `+fancy`, `+global`, `+web`
* Remove a tag by prefixing a tagname with a minus sign (a hyphen): `-fancy`, `-global`, `-web`. This is
  called a subtractive tag expression.
* Add a value by adding a `:` colon followed by a JSON literal: `+weight:"100kg"`
* Prefixing a tag with a minus as in `-tag` is equivalent to writing `+tag:false`
* Subtractive tags cannot have values.
